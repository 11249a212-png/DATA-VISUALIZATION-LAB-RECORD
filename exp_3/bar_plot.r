# Experiment: Bar Graph in R

## Aim
To create a bar graph using R programming to represent and compare values across different categories.

## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Define the categories and their corresponding values.
3. Use the `barplot()` function to create the bar graph.
4. Add a title and labels to the X-axis and Y-axis.
5. Set the colors of the bars.
6. Display the bar graph.
7. Stop the program.

## Description
A bar graph is a data visualization technique used to compare values among different categories. Each bar represents a category, and its height indicates the corresponding value.

In R, the `barplot()` function is used to create bar graphs. The `main` parameter specifies the title, `xlab` and `ylab` specify the axis labels, and `col` sets the bar colors.

## Program

```r
# Define the data
technologies <- c("Python", "Java", "R", "Tableau", "SQL")
marks <- c(85, 78, 82, 90, 88)

# Create the bar graph
barplot(marks,
        names.arg = technologies,
        main = "Marks in Different Technologies",
        xlab = "Technologies",
        ylab = "Marks",
        col = "lightblue",
        border = "black")
```

## Sample Output
A bar graph titled **Marks in Different Technologies** is displayed.

- X-axis: Technologies
- Y-axis: Marks
- Five bars represent Python, Java, R, Tableau, and SQL.
- Tableau has the highest value of 90.

## Result
Thus, a bar graph was successfully created using R to compare values across different categories.
