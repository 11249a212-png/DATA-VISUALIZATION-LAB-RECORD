# EXPERIMENT: LINE GRAPH USING PYTHON

## AIM
To create a line graph using Python's Matplotlib library to represent changes in values over a period of time.

## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Import the Matplotlib library.
3. Define the X-axis and Y-axis data.
4. Use the `plt.plot()` function to create the line graph.
5. Add a title to the graph.
6. Label the X-axis and Y-axis.
7. Display the graph using `plt.show()`.
8. Stop the program.

## DESCRIPTION
A line graph is a data visualization technique used to display changes in data over a continuous interval or period of time. It connects individual data points using straight lines to show trends and patterns.

Python's Matplotlib library provides the `plot()` function to create line graphs. In this program, monthly sales values are represented graphically to understand how sales change over time.

## PROGRAM

**File name: LineGraph.py**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun"]
sales = [100, 120, 90, 150, 170, 160]

plt.plot(months, sales, marker="o")
plt.title("Monthly Sales")
plt.xlabel("Months")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.show()
```

## PROGRAM EXPLANATION
1. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` – Imports the Matplotlib plotting module.
2. `months = [...]` – Stores the month names for the X-axis.
3. `sales = [...]` – Stores the corresponding sales values for the Y-axis.
4. `plt.plot(months, sales, marker="o")` – Creates a line graph and displays circular markers at each data point.
5. `plt.title("Monthly Sales")` – Sets the title of the graph.
6. `plt.xlabel("Months")` – Labels the X-axis as Months.
7. `plt.ylabel("Sales")` – Labels the Y-axis as Sales.
8. `plt.show()` – Displays the line graph.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```text
A line graph titled "Monthly Sales" is displayed.

X-axis: Months
Y-axis: Sales

Jan - 100
Feb - 120
Mar - 90
Apr - 150
May - 170
Jun - 160
```

The graph shows that sales increase from January to February, decrease in March, rise until May, and decrease slightly in June.

## RESULT
Thus, a line graph was successfully created using Python's Matplotlib library to represent changes in monthly sales.
