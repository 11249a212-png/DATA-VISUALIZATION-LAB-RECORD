# EXPERIMENT: SCATTER PLOT USING PYTHON

## AIM
To create a scatter plot using Python's Matplotlib library to visualize the relationship between study hours and marks.

## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Import the Matplotlib library.
3. Define the study hours and corresponding marks.
4. Use the `plt.scatter()` function to create the scatter plot.
5. Add a title to the plot.
6. Label the X-axis and Y-axis.
7. Display the plot using `plt.show()`.
8. Stop the program.

## DESCRIPTION
A scatter plot is a data visualization technique used to show the relationship between two numerical variables. It represents each observation as an individual point on a graph.

Python's Matplotlib library provides the `scatter()` function to create scatter plots. In this program, study hours are represented on the X-axis and marks are represented on the Y-axis. The plotted points help us understand the relationship between study hours and marks.

## PROGRAM

**File name: Scatter.py**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
hours = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
marks = [45, 50, 58, 65, 72, 80]
plt.scatter(hours, marks)
plt.title("Study Hours vs Marks")
plt.xlabel("Study Hours")
plt.ylabel("Marks")
plt.show()

"""Program Explanation
The scatter() function displays observations as individual points. Study hours are placed on the
X-axis and marks on the Y-axis. The resulting pattern can be used to study the relationship between
the variables."""
```

## PROGRAM EXPLANATION
1. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` – Imports the Matplotlib plotting module.
2. `hours = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` – Stores the study hours.
3. `marks = [45, 50, 58, 65, 72, 80]` – Stores the corresponding marks.
4. `plt.scatter(hours, marks)` – Creates the scatter plot using individual points.
5. `plt.title("Study Hours vs Marks")` – Sets the title of the plot.
6. `plt.xlabel("Study Hours")` – Labels the X-axis.
7. `plt.ylabel("Marks")` – Labels the Y-axis.
8. `plt.show()` – Displays the scatter plot.

## SAMPLE OUTPUT

```text
A scatter plot titled "Study Hours vs Marks" is displayed.

X-axis: Study Hours
Y-axis: Marks

Study Hours    Marks
     1           45
     2           50
     3           58
     4           65
     5           72
     6           80
```

The scatter plot displays six points. The points show an increasing trend, indicating that higher study hours are associated with higher marks in this sample dataset.

## RESULT
Thus, a scatter plot was successfully created using Python's Matplotlib library to visualize the relationship between study hours and marks.
